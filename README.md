The task management web app requires the user to create an account and login to access the main page to add, remove, view, or update a task.
When a user login it redirects him to the task management form, there are buttons handling the CRUD operations.
The server side were connected using node JS and http on port 8080 and passport.js for authentication, Express.js to define routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. MongoDB were used for task data persistence.
The application is responsive for various screen sizes using media queries and flexible layouts.
To run the app you have to launch the server.js file on your command prompt when you are in the right directory and use the command "node server.js" and click on the link of the local host it will redirect you to the login form.
